# Cost Tracking Implementation for Swarms API

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of cost tracking and model usage analytics in the Swarms API. The implementation includes both **response type definitions** and a **client-side cost calculation utility** that provides real-time cost calculations based on usage data.

## Problem Statement

The Swarms API was missing two important parameters in the response payload:
- `cost`: Essential for analytics, monitoring, and cost tracking
- `most_used_model`: Important for model usage analytics and optimization

While `execution_time` and other properties were correctly returned, these values were missing for consistency and full transparency.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Response Type Definitions
Added the missing fields to all relevant response types:
- `SwarmGetLogsResponse` - for the `POST /v1/swarm/logs` endpoint
- `SwarmRunResponse` - for individual swarm runs
- `AgentRunResponse` - for individual agent runs  
- `BatchRunResponse` - for batch operations

### 2. Client-Side Cost Calculator
Implemented a comprehensive cost calculation utility that:
- Calculates costs based on real usage data (tokens, requests, etc.)
- Supports multiple models with current market pricing
- Handles service tier multipliers
- Provides analytics and cost breakdowns
- Works independently of backend implementation

## Implementation Details

### Response Type Changes

#### SwarmGetLogsResponse
```python
class SwarmGetLogsResponse(BaseModel):
    count: Optional[int] = None
    logs: Optional[object] = None
    status: Optional[str] = None
    timestamp: Optional[str] = None
    
    # New fields
    cost: Optional[float] = None
    """The total cost of the swarm operations in the logs."""
    
    most_used_model: Optional[str] = None
    """The most frequently used model across all swarm operations in the logs."""
```

#### SwarmRunResponse
```python
class SwarmRunResponse(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # New fields
    cost: Optional[float] = None
    """The cost of this swarm operation."""
    
    most_used_model: Optional[str] = None
    """The most frequently used model in this swarm operation."""
```

#### AgentRunResponse
```python
class AgentRunResponse(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # New fields
    cost: Optional[float] = None
    """The cost of this agent operation."""
    
    most_used_model: Optional[str] = None
    """The model used in this agent operation."""
```

#### BatchRunResponse
```python
class BatchRunResponse(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # New fields
    cost: Optional[float] = None
    """The total cost of all operations in this batch."""
    
    most_used_model: Optional[str] = None
    """The most frequently used model across all batch operations."""
```

#### Key Features

1. **Real-time Cost Calculation**
   ```python
   cost = calculator.calculate_operation_cost(
       usage_data={"prompt_tokens": 1000, "completion_tokens": 500},
       model_name="gpt-4",
       service_tier="premium"
   )
   ```

2. **Swarm Cost Calculation**
   ```python
   cost_info = calculate_swarm_response_cost(
       response_data=swarm_response,
       agents=agent_configs
   )
   ```

3. **Batch Cost Calculation**
   ```python
   cost_info = calculate_batch_response_cost(batch_response)
   ```

4. **Logs Cost Calculation**
   ```python
   cost_info = calculate_logs_response_cost(logs_response)
   ```

5. **Custom Pricing Support**
   ```python
   custom_pricing = ModelPricing(
       model_name="custom-model",
       input_cost_per_1k_tokens=0.001,
       output_cost_per_1k_tokens=0.002
   )
   calculator.add_model_pricing("custom-model", custom_pricing)
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Cost Calculation
```python
from src.swarms_client._cost_calculator import get_cost_calculator

calculator = get_cost_calculator()

# Calculate cost for a GPT-4 operation
usage_data = {
    "prompt_tokens": 1500,
    "completion_tokens": 500,
    "total_tokens": 2000
}

cost = calculator.calculate_operation_cost(
    usage_data=usage_data,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    service_tier="standard"
)

print(f"Operation cost: ${cost:.6f}")
# Output: Operation cost: $0.076000
```

### Swarm Response Cost Calculation
```python
from src.swarms_client._cost_calculator import calculate_swarm_response_cost

# Example swarm response
swarm_response = {
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 3000,
        "completion_tokens": 1200,
        "total_tokens": 4200
    },
    "service_tier": "premium"
}

agents = [
    {"agent_name": "researcher", "model_name": "gpt-4"},
    {"agent_name": "analyst", "model_name": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"}
]

cost_info = calculate_swarm_response_cost(swarm_response, agents)

print(f"Total cost: ${cost_info['total_cost']:.6f}")
print(f"Most used model: {cost_info['most_used_model']}")
```

### Cost Comparison
```python
# Compare costs across different models and tiers
models = ["gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4", "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"]
tiers = ["flex", "standard", "premium"]

usage_data = {"prompt_tokens": 2000, "completion_tokens": 800}

for model in models:
    for tier in tiers:
        cost = calculator.calculate_operation_cost(
            usage_data=usage_data,
            model_name=model,
            service_tier=tier
        )
        print(f"{model} ({tier}): ${cost:.4f}")
```

## Cost Calculation Formula

The cost calculation follows this formula:

```
Base Cost = (prompt_tokens * input_cost_per_1k_tokens + 
             completion_tokens * output_cost_per_1k_tokens) / 1000

Tier Adjusted Cost = Base Cost * service_tier_multiplier

Agent Multiplier = min(num_agents * 0.8, 5.0)  # For swarm operations

Final Cost = Tier Adjusted Cost * Agent Multiplier + 0.001 (overhead)
```
